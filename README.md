# ScoreKeep Version 1.0
## Created by Joshua Seward

### General Idea
Create a fully functioning score/stat-keeping program that works for multiple different sports.

### Baseball Stat-Keeping

Begin with a basic Baseball stat keeping program that takes in an input file of a team's roster/lineup and 
tracks their stats throughout a game. At a minimum, it should track basic batting, fielding, and pitching stats,
and write the final game stats to an output stats file.
